# qT1
Pipeline for generating quantitative T1 maps from 7T MP2RAGE.
Initial parts from https://github.com/JosePMarques/MP2RAGE-related-scripts
Generates surface-mapped T1 values at different depths and averaged across cortical depths.

## TODO
Sample at different depths and average across different sets of depths. 
Compensate for curvature by residualizing.
Compensate for blood vessels. 
Visualize the superior temporal plane.
